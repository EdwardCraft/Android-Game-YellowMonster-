# Android-Game-YellowMonster
=============================
This is a Minigame for Android devices developed in Android Studio and Libgdx API. This project was developed as practice for making 
simple games for Android devices, from things like asset loading to adding ads.

============================
### Running
There should be no problem running the project using android studio, like I mention before this game contains ads, so in 
order to uses this functionality you must have an AdMob account and generate an Ad unit ID.
